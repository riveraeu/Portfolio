p1: "Developing a new mobile experience at RH was a huge undertaking. With an unresponsive ecommerce website in 2019, the opportunity to improve the mobile experience and thus drive sales was immense. The project spanned many different teams and departments, but for us in the digital creative world, our job was to redesign and update all of our content (non-product) pages"
p2: "One of our goals as a team was to break away from having all our text baked into image assets and not coded. While this does help to keep the design consistent, it posed a number of other technical and logistical problems that we felt it was time to address."
p3: "At RH we put a lot of time and value into the aesthetics of our brand. Every piece of content is scrutinised and improved upon until it is the best that we can make it. Mobile was no exception, and the pressure was on to make the experience pixel perfect."
p4: "Our designers put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their work and as a developer it was my job to honor that and make sure that the implementation was as close to the design as possible. This process has been a great learning experience for me at RH. There is a certain joy in bringing a static design document and giving it life in a dynamic environment."
p5: "With development resources at a premium, we had to come up with a lot of creative solutions to implement the desired design. The team’s focus was on improving the experience as much as possible for mobile devices, while still being true to our brand aesthetics and message. A big part of this project for our team was revamping our gallery and restaurant pages. The galleries are an important expression of our brand, and the web experience needed to convey that fact, as much as the physical locations did."
