## RH World

As the RH brand expands, we looked into how to best represent all the different aspects of the buisness on the web. The idea of the world of RH emerged as a concept to link to all our different sub-brands. Our team put together some design comps and I built several prototypes of what this site may look like. This has been one of my favorite projects here at RH because it was so creative and really challenged me at points. I have listed some of the prototypes below as examples (please note these are prototypes designed for desktop):
